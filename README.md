A javascript applet made for the Skillshare course "Build a Tip Calculator" by Chris Dixon.
Code is mostly from that course, with some flourishes added by me:
>The stuff under the Split slider is hidden unless you slide it to multiple people.<p>
>The "Bill Per Person" is new, and differentiated from "Bill Each".<p>
>The Tip slider defaults to 15% and moves in increments of 5%.<p>
>All values reset on page load!<p>
>Tweaked visuals<p>
>The name is changed lol
