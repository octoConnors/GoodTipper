# GoodTipper
A javascript applet made for the Skillshare course "Build a Tip Calculator" by Chris Dixon.
Code is mostly from that course, with some flourished added by me:
>The stuff under the Split slider is hidden unless you slide it to multiple people.
>The "Bill Per Person" is new, and differentiated from "Bill Each".
>The Tip slider defaults to 15% and moves in increments of 5%.
>Tweaked visuals
>The name is changed lol
